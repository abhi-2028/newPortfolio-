    <h2>Abhirup's Summary :</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently a BTech 1st-semester student, and I've set a goal for myself
      to score 90% or higher in my CBSE board exams. During my 11th and 12th
      grades in the ISC board, I learned Java, which gave me a strong foundation
      in programming. Now, I’m focused on mastering C and C++, especially in the
      area of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I’ve been working through
      various pattern programs, and I find the challenge of understanding
      complex coding concepts both stimulating and rewarding. As I progress in
      my studies, I’m constantly seeking ways to improve and push myself further
      in programming.<br />
      Beyond academics, music is a big part of my life, especially playing the
      guitar. I own a Zoom G3XN, which is a multi-effects processor that allows
      me to experiment with a wide range of guitar sounds and effects. It’s a
      great way for me to channel my creativity and balance the intensity of my
      studies. Being able to focus on both technical skills and creative
      interests helps me maintain a well-rounded approach to life. Whether it’s
      improving in coding or exploring new musical styles, I’m always driven to
      aim high and achieve excellence.
